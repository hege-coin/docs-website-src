# Hegecoin docs website source code

This repo holds the source files for the Hegecoin docs website, found at
[docs.hegecoin.com](https://docs.hegecoin.com).

It's a static website, built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with a custom
minimal theme.

The static HTML generated by Hugo is served by GitHub Pages, from a separate Git
repo: [docs-website].

## Building and publishing

This is how to build and publish the site:

```sh
./build.sh
cd output-build/
git add --all
git commit -m "<message>"
git push -u origin main
```

The `build.sh` script will first run `hugo`, which writes its output to
`public/`. It will then copy this output to `output-build/`, apply some post
processing to tidy up the HTML, and copy in a few other files from
`output-base/`.

The content of `output-build/` is version controlled in a separate Git repo,
stored in `build-git/`. This repo is then used to host the site on GitHub Pages.
See [docs-website].
