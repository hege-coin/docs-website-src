## Token allocation

The token allocation for Hege is as follows:

- 45% Liquidity pool allocation.
- 50% Presale allocation.
- 5% Team allocation.

Our tokenomics were systematically designed with total fairness in mind. We
didn't save any huge allocations for marketing here, as these were tokens that
would have to be sold, or passed over to KOLs. We set out with a plan to grow
organically and that is exactly what we have achieved thus far. Aside from Hege
Dev, everyone has purchased their tokens, meaning we all have skin in the game.
