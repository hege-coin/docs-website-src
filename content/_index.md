## Introduction

Hege is more than just a project with memes and a storyline. We are aiming to
build a community full of humor, transparency and knowledge. The original
concept for Hege was for him to win over his crush, Hegena, but as the project
progressed, the team realized that there’s other narratives that they can
utilize, alongside the storyline.

We envision Hege as being a safe haven for beginners in the memecoin space. What
do we mean by this? Although we are aware that no project in this space can be
truly guaranteed positive returns, we pride ourselves on Hege being a space that
is immune from price manipulation, rug pulls and shady business.

We can’t control the charts, but we can influence them through our actions — and
our actions are consistent, and working towards our larger vision.

## United by us, for all of us

Hege was created by one man, but quickly grew to become a team project, a team
that previously had few connections in the space, and without financial backing.
All of the team are invested and have the success of the project in their best
interests. We’ve got here without any huge spend, favors from influential
friends, or insider cash injections. We’ve made it to where we are organically,
and people like that. The team are all regular people with day jobs, and a
normal life. We’re here to make a change in the space.
