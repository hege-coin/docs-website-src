## As Hege's market cap grows, new content is unlocked

The Hege story unlocks as we progress in market cap. This is our main
differentiating factor between other memecoin projects. We set our sights high
for $HEGE and that’s why we plan on releasing the final chapter at $1 billion
market cap. The team aims to outdo themselves each unlock by creating better and
better content. There’s even talks of a full length feature film at $1 billion!

We run marketing campaigns around each chapter, creating hype and building
anticipation. We've found that this unique system attracts the price to these
level, rather than acting as resistance.
